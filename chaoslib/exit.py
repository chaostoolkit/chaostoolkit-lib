"""
This module is advanced usage and mostly interesting to users who need to
be able to terminate an experiment's execution as fast as possible and,
potentially, without much care for cleaning up afterwards.

If you want to interrup an execution but can affort to wait for graceful
completion (current activty, rollbacks...) it's probably best to rely on
the control interface.

If you need this utility here, you can simply do as follows:


```python
from chaoslib.exit import exit_ungracefully

def my_probe():
    # whatever condition comes up that shows you need to terminate asap
    exit_ungracefully()
```

Then in your experiment

```json
"method": [
    {
        "type": "probe",
        "name": "interrupt-when-system-is-unhappy",
        "background": True,
        "provider": {
            "type": "python",
            "module": "mymod",
            "func": "my_probe"
        }
    }
    ...
]
```

This will start your probe in the background.
